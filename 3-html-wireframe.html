                <p>Ellis is a word nerd and social media junkie studying Telecommunications and English at the University of Florida. While originally from Mississippi, her education and organizational involvement have taken her all over the world. Aside from travel, her free time is almost wholly taken up by books, either by reading or editing.</p>
                <p>Ellis currently lives, works, and studies in Gainesville, Florida, but her involvment with organizations around the world is facilitated by her focus on online communications and social media. These tools have allowed her to jumpstart her publishing career by working with texts and their authors from hundreds of miles away.
